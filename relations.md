# Relations and the Collection Model

The BTAA Geoportal aggregates from many different sources. This document describes how to organize and relate the records.

## Collections
The BTAA Geoportal interprets Collections as top-level, custom groupings. 
These reflect our curation activities and priorities.

As of 2022, the Collections are:

### General Land Office Township Plats
Plat drawings created from public land surveys completed in the Big Ten Academic Alliance States.

### Government Open Geospatial Data Collection
Open geospatial datasets, web services, interactive maps, and data portals distributed by a federal, state, county, municipal, or regional agency.

### Indigenous Lands
Resources and projects that address issues related to indigenous people, territories, reservations, languages, land grants, and more.

### Libraries Geospatial Data Collection
Geospatial data that has been curated at academic libraries. Many of the datasets are outputs from research projects or sponsored initiatives. This collection also encompasses government data that was curated and archived at a library.
The items in this collection are known to have high quality standards metadata and stable access links.
These records are shared on OpenGeoMetadata under each institution's repository.

### Libraries Historical Maps Collection
This collection contains scanned images of historical maps held in libraries.
The geographic scope of this collection features a concentration on the states in the Big Ten Academic Alliance region, but also includes maps from all over the world. 
The items in this collection are known to have high quality metadata and stable access links.
These records are shared on OpenGeoMetadata under each institution's repository.

### Licensed Resources Collection
Licensed resources are authorized for use by an individual university, or by multiple universities in the Big Ten Academic Alliance through a subscription. Access to these databases is paid for by an institution for affiliates to use, unlike free public use data.

### Public Health Dashboards
Links to dashboards and hubs that track public health statistics related to the Covid-19 Coronavirus pandemic.

### Research Institutes Geospatial Data Collection
Resources from various nonprofit institutions, commercial entities, and research repositories. The geographic scope is worldwide. The topical focus includes environment, climate, humanitarian issues, and racial equity.
