#Entry and Usage Guidelines
The BTAA Geoportal has more specific guidelines for some fields from OpenGeoMetadata.

### Title
**Maps**: The title for scanned maps is generally left as it was originally cataloged by a participating library. MARC subfields are omitted and can be inserted in the Description field.

**Datasets**: Harvested datasets often are lacking descriptive titles and may need to be augmented with place names. Dates may also be added to the end, but if the dataset is subject to updates, the data should be left off.  Acronyms should be spelled out.

The preferred format for dataset titles is:
`Theme [place] {date}`. This punctuation allows for batch processing and splitting title elements.

### Language
Although Language is optional in the OGM schema, a three-digit code is required for the BTAA Geoportal.

### Creator
Acronyms should be spelled out.

### Publisher
The BTAA Geoportal does not use the Publisher field for Datasets.

### Provider
This is the name of the organization hosting the resources. If the organization is part of the BTAA library network, a university icon will display next to the resource's title. However, most Providers will not have an icon.

The BTAA Geoportal has a much longer list of Providers than other GeoBlacklight instances. This is because we are harvesting metadata from external sources, rather than just participating library institutions.
