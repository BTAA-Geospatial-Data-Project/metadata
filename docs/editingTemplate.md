The [GeoBTAA Metadata Template](https://z.umn.edu/b1g-template) is a set of spreadsheets that are formatted for upload to our metadata editor, GEOMG. 

Users will need to make a copy of the spreadsheet to use for editing.  In some cases, the Metadata Coordinator can provide a customized version of the sheets for specific collections.

The Template contains the following tabs:

- Map Template
- Dataset Template
- Website Record Template
- Values: All of the controlled vocabulary values for the associated fields.
