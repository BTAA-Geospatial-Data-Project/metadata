**Identifying Resources to Submit to the BTAA Geoportal**

The BTAA Geoportal holds metadata records that point to geospatial data, maps, aerial imagery, and websites hosted online by external organizations. It is the role of the Team members to seek out new content for the geoportal. Regional or national collections will be selected by the Collections Steering Group.
