# How to submit resources to the BTAA Geoportal

## 1. Identify Resources

It is the role of the Team members to seek out new content for the geoportal.

    - State GIS clearinghouses
    - State agencies (especially DNRs and DOTs)
    - County or city GIS departments
    - Library digital collections
    - Research institutes
    - Nonprofit organizations

Review the [Collection Strategy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aRjH36dM76G_LCIUGJo1cIl4IGBizvA-Qncp39_DMic/edit?usp=sharing) and the [Collection Development Policy](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vSdSB7F_ZMDUppmkK-szsCBgPg5KBOr9mDpYsaOyqUx0lGghPVYJKfaZq5S46dVGZ_zB5EsyJLOZayN/pub) for more details.

## 2. Optional: Contact the organization

- Use [this template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xqYbutgsrH5UTjKC9m5oBagIgk-8sSCpbYiZ5-tlZr8/edit?usp=sharing) to inform the organization that we plan to include their resources in our geoportal.
- If metadata for the resources are not readily available, the organization may be able to send them to you.

## 3. Contact the BTAA-GIN Product Manager

Send an email, Slack message to the BTAA-GIN Product Manager / Metadata Coordinator.

Things to include:

- a link to the website
- Title and Description of the collection
- (If known) information about how to harvest the metadata or construct access links

The submission will be added to our collections processing queue.
