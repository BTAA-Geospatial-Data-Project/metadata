These recipes are step-by-step how-to guides for harvesting and processing metadata from the sites that we harvest the most frequently.

The scripts needed for these recipes are all in the form of Jupyter Notebooks. To get started, download, fork, or clone the [Harvesting Guide repository](https://github.com/geobtaa/harvesting-guide).


!!! warning

	These recipes are not guaranteed to work! Since they rely on external websites, the scripts are necessarily works-in-progress. They need to be regularly updated and reconfigured in response to changes at the source website, python updates, and adjustments to our metadata schema.
