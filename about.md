# About Metadata for the BTAA Geoportal

## The OpenGeoMetadata Schema
- The primary metadata record for each resource uses the official GeoBlacklight schema, known as OpenGeoMetadata. The current version of OpenGeoMetadata is called 'Aardvark'. 
- This lightweight schema was designed specifically for the GeoBlacklight application and is geared towards discoverability. 
- [The schema is documented on the OpenGeoMetadata website](https://opengeometadata.org).


## B1G Project Specific Features
- The B1G profile of the GeoBlacklight Schema adds ten custom elements to OpenGeoMetadata
- [The B1G custom elements are documented here](b1gProfile.html)

## Editing Template
The [B1G Metadata Template](https://z.umn.edu/b1g-template) contains the following tabs:
- Map Template
- Dataset Template
- Website Record Template
- Values: All of the controlled vocabulary values for the various fields.


## Supplemental Metadata
All other forms of metadata, such as ISO 19139, FGDC Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata, attribute table definitions, or custom schemas are treated as **Supplemental Metadata**.
- Supplemental Metadata is not usually edited directly for inclusion in the project.
- If this metadata is available as XML or HTML, it can be added as a hosted link for the Metadata preview tool in GeoBlacklight.
- XML or HTML files can be parsed to extract metadata that forms the basis for the itemâ€™s GeoBlacklight schema record.
- The file formats that can be viewed within the geoportal application include:
    - ISO 19139 XML
    - FGDC XML
    - MODS XML
    - HTML (any standard)
