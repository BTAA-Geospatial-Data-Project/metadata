Title Maps : The title for scanned maps is generally left as it was originally cataloged by a participating library. MARC subfields are omitted and can be inserted in the Description field. Datasets : Harvested datasets often are lacking descriptive titles and may need to be augmented with place names. Dates may also be added to the end, but if the dataset is subject to updates, the data should be left off. Acronyms should be spelled out. The preferred format for dataset titles is: Theme [place] {date} . This punctuation allows for batch processing and splitting title elements. Language Although Language is optional in the OGM schema , a three-digit code is required for the BTAA Geoportal. Creator Spell all Acronyms out. Publisher Maps : Publisher values for maps are pulled from the original catalog record. Remove subfields for place names and dates. Datasets : The BTAA Geoportal does not use the Publisher field for Datasets. Provider This is the name of the organization hosting the resources.

Submit Records Criteria for submission The BTAA Geoportal holds metadata records that point to geospatial data, maps, aerial imagery, and websites hosted online by external organizations. It is the role of the Team members to seek out new content for the geoportal. Team members are responsible for finding records in their own or adjacent states. Regional or national collections will be selected by the Collections Steering Group. Review the Collections Strategy and the Collections Development Policy for more details. Places to find public domain collections State GIS clearinghouses State agencies (especially DNRs and DOTs) County or city GIS departments Library digital collections Research institutes Nonprofit organizations How to submit new records 1. Optional: Contact the organization Use this template to inform the organization that we plan to include their resources in our geoportal.

The submission will be added to our collections processing queue Metadata processing tasks are tracked on our public GitHub project dashboard .

Metadata Transition This stage involves batch processing of the records, including harvesting, transformations, crosswalking information. This stage is carried out by the Metadata Coordinator, who may contact Team members for assistance. Regardless of the method used for acquiring the metadata, it is always transformed into a spreadsheet for editing. These spreadsheets are uploaded to GEOMG Metadata Editor. Because of the variety of platforms and standards, this process can take many forms. The Metadata Coordinator will contact Team members if they need to supply metadata directly. Here are the most common methods per resource type: Geospatial data API Harvesting Most data portals have APIs that can be programmatically parsed to obtain metadata for each record. DCAT enabled portals: ArcGIS Open Data Portals (HUB), Socrata portals, and some others share metadata in the DCAT standard . This is typically accessed by appending \u201c/data.json\u201d to the end of the portal\u2019s base URL. View our harvesting scripts for DCAT enabled portals here. CKAN / DKAN portals: This application uses a custom metadata schema for their API. View our harvesting scripts for CKAN portals here. HTML Parsing If a data portal or website does not have an API, we may be able to parse the HTML pages to obtain the metadata needed to create GeoBlacklight schema records. This is done using custom View our harvesting scripts for HTML parsing here. Individual Geospatial Metadata Standard files Geospatial metadata standards are expressed in the XML format, which can be parsed to extract metadata needed to create GeoBlacklight schema records. The following file types are accepted for metadata extraction and can serve as Supplemental Metadata: ISO 19139 XML and FGDC XML files : They are parsed to extract metadata values for GeoBlacklight metadata using the project created Python scripts found in BTAA-Geospatial-Data-Project/parse-xml ArcGIS 1.0 Metadata XML files : These records are transformed to ISO 19139 using XSLT. They are then treated the same as the ISO as described above. Downloading Data Some metadata is only available as part of a zipped download of the datasets. In this case, UMN staff will use scripts to batch download the records, unzip them, and process their metadata locally. Maps OAI-PMH The Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) is a framework that can be used to harvest metadata records from enabled repositories. The records are usually available as a simple Dublin Core XML format. If the protocol is not set up to include extra fields, such as the map image's download link or bounding box, this method may not be sufficient on its own. Spreadsheets Administrators for university repositories for scanned maps or data can often export metadata into a spreadsheet, especially for Dublin Core. This method is preferred, because the University IT professionals and librarians can control which fields to export, and because transformations by the Metadata Coordinator are not necessary. The B1G Map Template shows all of the fields needed for GeoBlacklight. MARC files The best way to transfer this type of metadata is to send a single file containing multiple records in the .MRC or MARC XML format. The Metadata Coordinator will use MarcEdit or XML parsing to transform the records to GeoBlacklight using the project-designated MARC to GBL crosswalk, but Team Members can specify preferences. 3. Edit Records Once the metadata is in spreadsheet form, it is ready to be normalized and augmented. UMN Staff will add template information and use spreadsheet functions or scripts to programmatically complete the metadata records. The GBL Metadata Template is for creating GeoBlacklight metadata. Refer to the documentation for the Aardvark fields and the B1G profile fields for guidance on values and formats. 4. Publish Records Once the editing spreadsheets are completed, UMN Staff uploads the records to GEOMG , a metadata management tool. GEOMG validates records and performs any needed field transformations. Once the records are satisfactory, they are published and available in the BTAA Geoportal. Maintenance General Maintenance All project team members are encouraged to review the geoportal records assigned to their institutions periodically to check for issues. Use the feedback form at the top of each page in the geoportal to report errors or suggestions. This submission will include the URL of the last page you were on, and it will be sent to the Metadata Coordinator. Broken Links The geoportal will be programmatically checked for broken links on a monthly basis. Systematic errors will be fixed by UMN Staff. Some records from this report may be referred back to Team Members for investigating broken links. Subsequent Accessions Portals that utilize the DCAT metadata standard will be re-accessioned monthly. Other GIS data portals will be periodically re-accessioned by the Metadata Coordinator at least once per year. Team members may be asked to review this work and provide input on decisions for problematic records. Retired Records When an external resource has been moved, deleted, or versioned to a new access link, the original record is retired from the BTAA Geoportal. This is done by converting the Publication State of the record from 'Published' to 'Unpublished'. The record is not deleted from the database and can still be accessed via a direct link. However, it will not show up in any search queries.","title":"Lifecycle"},{"location":"lifecycle/#lifecycle-of-btaa-geoportal-metadata-records","text":"```","title":"Lifecycle of BTAA Geoportal Metadata Records"},{"location":"lifecycle/#1-submit-records","text":"Criteria for submission The BTAA Geoportal holds metadata records that point to geospatial data, maps, aerial imagery, and websites hosted online by external organizations.

It is a flat system whereby every database entry is a \"Layer\" and uses the same metadata fields. Unlike many digital library applications, it does not have different types of records for entities such as \"communities,\" \"collections,\" or \"groups.\" As a result, it does not present a breadcrumb navigation structure, and all records appear in the same catalog directory with the URL of https:geo.btaa.org/catalog/ ID . Instead of a hierarchy, GeoBlacklight relates records via metadata fields. These fields include Member Of , Is Part Of , Is Version Of , Source , and a general Relation . This flexibility allows records to be presented in several different ways. For example, records can have multiple parent/child/grandchild/sibling relationships. In addition, they can be nested (i.e., a collection can belong to another collection). They can also connect data layers about similar topics or represent different years in a series.
